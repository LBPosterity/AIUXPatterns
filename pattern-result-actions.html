      <div class="col">
        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p class="large">Result actions serve to provide a quick & easy workflow for complex actions a user might take. Similar to result options although much more specific per context & usually a more complex task than "copy" for example.
        <br><br>
        Result actions are a key place to personalise your products quick options to simplify complex workflows for your user.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h5>User Archetype</h5>
        <p>Depending on the actions provided, novice users can benefit from pre-canned options like "more succinct", however, they can also serve to educate them on the system abilities. For example if an action like "refactor into JSON" was presented, a user may not have even been aware the system could achieve this type of action.
        <br><br>
        More advanced users would appreciate these actions being tailored to their specific workflows & potentially even performing multi step actions. An action like "Convert to Excel graph with normalised values" is very niche but would serve a particular user extremely well.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">
        <h5>Considerations</h5>
        <p>The key consideration here is context. What do you know about your users & what are they trying to achieve. Can you provide actions that go beyond evolving the immediate result & support their larger workflow?.
          <br><br>
        This UI example shows useful but single actions presented as buttons, however, consider if your actions may need further descriptive text or multi mode options & adjust their presentation to suit.
