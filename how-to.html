    <h1>How to use the UI pattern references</h1>
    <p class="large">These simplified UI examples are meant as a clarifying reference as you & your team evaluate common or new design patterns for AI interfaces.</p>
    <p>Each pattern is not a complete workflow but is an abstracted example of a particular user experience design approach that could be adopted & combined with others to create an optimised AI experience for users.</p>

  </div>


  <div class="col-3-wrapper col-highlight">
    
    <div>
      <h5>Step 1</h5>
      <p class="">Have a clear goal for what success looks like for your design. Define the workflow & it's requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>Step 2</h5>
      <p class="">Review the patterns to see which one best fits your use case & user type.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>Step 3</h5>
      <p class="">Use this reference, along with re world examples, to align on the approach for your bespoke design.</p>

      <h2>How LLM's are different</h2>
      <p>The majority of software utilise the common logic <strong>If > Then</strong> statements which are strung together to achive complex tasks. These allow us to code business logic into our products for reliable outcomes.</p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>LLM's (AI) are different, the natural language models aren't hard coded, they're more like a magical black box.</p>
      <p>Although extremely powerful, the answers these AI models provide aren't always 100% accurate. The possibiliy of hallucinations (or lies) mean the AI output needs to be reviewed & interpreted by someone.</p> 
      <p>This will change as they become more reliable, but this is the key different when crafting AI user experiences.</p>

          <h1>Prompt abstraction types</h1>
          <p class="large">The input for AI models are "simple" text prompt. While writing some text is easy enough, emedding a prompt with an effective amount of detail, content, specificity & direction is a skill. A skill the majority of users either are not capable of or do not have the time to author.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Like all user intefaces, we're abstracting a complex process or input to make it more intuitive & usable for people.</p>
          <p>There 4 broad categories of rompt abstraction that potentially wrrant a specific UI. These types are:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Direct Prompt</strong><br>
              Users input text is directly fed to the AI model.</li>
              <li><strong>Supplemented Prompt</strong><br>
              The user prompt is embedded into existing prompt perameters.</li>
              <li><strong>Prompt Variables</strong><br>
              User selections influence variables in existing prompt peramters.</li>
              <li><strong>Variable Composition</strong><br>
              Larger prompt sections are conditionally included or omitted.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

    <summary><h5>How do I use this guide?</h5></summary>
    <p class="large">Like all user interface patterns each one is optimised for a particular context or user type. It's important to have your individual requirements defined so you them to them to then assess what which pattern may work best for your product.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h5>Are these designs complete?</h5></summary>
    <p class="large">No, these are simplified mockups to simply illustrate a UI pattern and how it's core elements interact.</p> 

    <p class="large">The constituent elements could be presented in a sidebar area, inline with other UI elements, in a modal or however your product needs to present them to best support your users.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h5>Can I have access to the Figma files?</h5></summary>
    <p class="large">As these UI examples are meant to present the key UI elements as a conversation reference the particular layout or atomic elements aren't meant to be used directly. However, sharing is caring, email me at luke@lukebennis.com and I can share them with you.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h5>Does this help me with my AI strategy?</h5></summary>
    <p class="large">No, these patterns represent options for interface designs once you know you're implementing an AI feature & understand you're project and user requirements.</p>
