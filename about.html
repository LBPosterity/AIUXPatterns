      <h1>Using AI UX patterns</h1>
      <p class="large">This guide catalogues the UX design patterns applicable to delivering effective AI experiences. 
        <br><br>
        AI has brought with it a new paradigm moving from command to intent based inputs & some of our existing UX patterns are applicable while other completely new ones will be designed.
        <br><br>
        Real world example are useful, however abstracted examples like these allow us to focus on the core elements & interaction in each pattern, so designers & developers can evaluate & adapt them to their products context.</p>

      <h5>Step 1</h5>
      <p class="">Have a clear goal for what success looks like for your design. Define the workflow & it's requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>Step 2</h5>
      <p class="">Review the patterns to see which ones best fit your product & user type.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h5>Step 3</h5>
      <p class="">Use this reference, along with real world examples, to align on an effective design solution.</p>

      <h2>How LLM's are different</h2>
      <p>The majority of software utilises the common logic of <strong>If > Then</strong> statements which are then strung together to achieve complex tasks. Allowing us to code business logic into products for reliable & consistent outcomes.</p>
      <p>But...</p>
      <p>AI (LLM's) is different, the natural language models aren't hard coded, they're more like a magical black box.</p>
      <p>Although extremely powerful, the answers these models provide aren't always accurate. The possibility of hallucinations (lies) mean that the output needs to be reviewed & interpreted by users. This will evolve as models become more reliable, but this is the key difference to consider when crafting AI user experiences.</p>

          <h1>Prompt abstraction types</h1>
          <p class="large">The input for AI models are "simple" text prompts. While writing some text is easy enough, imbuing a prompt with an effective amount of detail, context & direction is a skill. A skill the majority of users either are not capable of or do not have the time to execute.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Like all user interfaces, we aim to abstract a complex process to make it more intuitive & usable for people.</p>
          <p>There are 4 broad categories of prompt abstraction that potentially warrant a specific UI. These types are:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Direct Prompt</strong><br>
              Users input text is directly fed to the AI model without edit or addition.</li>
              <li><strong>Supplemented Prompt</strong><br>
              The user prompt is embedded into existing prompt template.</li>
              <li><strong>Prompt Variables</strong><br> 
              User selections influence variables in existing prompt template.</li>
              <li><strong>Variable Composition</strong><br>
              Larger prompt sections are conditionally included or omitted.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>

  <h2>FAQ's</h2>
  <p><br></p>

  <details>
    <summary><h5>How do I use this guide?</h5></summary>
    <p class="large">Like all user interface patterns each one is optimised for a particular context or user type. It's important to have your individual requirements defined so you them to them to then assess what which pattern may work best for your product.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h5>Are these designs complete?</h5></summary>
    <p class="large">No, these are simplified mockups to simply illustrate a UI pattern and how it's core elements interact.</p> 

    <p class="large">The constituent elements could be presented in a sidebar area, inline with other UI elements, in a modal or however your product needs to present them to best support your users.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h5>Can I have access to the Figma files?</h5></summary>
    <p class="large">As these UI examples are meant to present the key UI elements as a conversation reference the particular layout or atomic elements aren't meant to be used directly. However, sharing is caring, email me at luke@lukebennis.com and I can share them with you.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h5>Does this help me with my AI strategy?</h5></summary>
    <p class="large">No, these patterns represent options for interface designs once you know you're implementing an AI feature & understand you're project and user requirements.</p> 
  </details>

  <h2>Feedback</h2>
  <p class="large">I'd love your feedback. Did I miss a pattern? Does somethign need correcting?</p>
  <p>This reference guide was made by one curious designer in their spare time. If you've got feedback, don't hesitate, email me at <a mailto="luke@lukebennis.com">luke@lukebennis.com</a>.</p>
